Animated countdown that features a reset button. Runs through '.nums span' node list to create a countdown. CSS translate is used to create rotation effect as the numbers enter into view.

##Sass
Sass was used as an additional challenge on my part to begin working on a set of mixins, variables, components, ect for my own personal templates later on.
